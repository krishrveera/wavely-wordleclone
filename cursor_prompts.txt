(USER) what is the basic mvp of wordle?
(CURSOR) I'll help you understand the basic MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of Wordle. Wordle is a popular word-guessing game with these core features:
A secret 5-letter word that players need to guess
Players get 6 attempts to guess the word
After each guess, the game provides feedback:
Green: Letter is correct and in the right position
Yellow: Letter is in the word but in the wrong position
Gray: Letter is not in the word
Let me create a simple web-based MVP of Wordle using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'll create three files:
First, I'll create an HTML file for the structure.
{Creates the MVP}
I've created a basic MVP of Wordle with the following features:
A 6x5 grid representing the game board
Keyboard input handling for letters and backspace
Color-coded feedback:
Green (correct): Letter is in the correct position
Yellow (present): Letter is in the word but wrong position
Gray (absent): Letter is not in the word
Game state management:
Tracks current row and tile position
Handles win/lose conditions
Displays appropriate messages
To play the game:
Open index.html in a web browser
Type letters using your keyboard
Press Enter to submit a guess
Use Backspace to delete letters
You have 6 attempts to guess the 5-letter word
The game includes a small set of sample words, but you can easily expand the WORDS array in script.js to include more words.
Some notable features of this MVP:
Responsive design that works on different screen sizes
Proper handling of duplicate letters in words
Clear visual feedback for correct/present/absent letters
Game over states for both winning and losing

(USER) Perfect it works! lets style this up a bit though, I like that its minimal, lets remove MVP altogether from the title and then lets give this a sort of pale marine blue baground, and rename Wordle into some other name that you can come up with for a game like this, the text could be in the same font but change the text color to a lighter blue and then the boses themselves could be the same pale light blue like the text, but the text inside the boxes could be the pale marine blue of the baground and then maybe a set of instructions could be given to the left of the screen on how to play the game
(CURSOR) I'll help you modify the game with a new ocean-themed design. Let's call it "WAVELY" - a word guessing game with a marine aesthetic. I'll update all three files.
